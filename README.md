# Classification of Brain Tumors

The dataset provided by Kaggle contains 4 classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary and no tumor. The custom neural network contains 22 layers and uses tensorflow for its implementation. Currently, the model yields an approximate accuracy of 45%.<br/> Note: data is in the process of being augmented.<br/>
